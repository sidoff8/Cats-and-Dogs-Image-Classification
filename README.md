  <h3>Image classification!</h3>
  <p>Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”). You can look at a picture and know that you’re looking at a terrible shot of your own face, but how can a computer learn to do that?</p>
<h4>A CNN has</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Convolutional layers</li>
    <li>ReLU layers</li>
    <li>Pooling layers</li>
    <li>a Fully connected layer</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>A classic CNN architecture would look something like this:</h4>
<h5>Input ->Convolution ->ReLU ->Convolution ->ReLU ->Pooling ->
  ReLU ->Convolution ->ReLU ->Pooling ->Fully Connected</h5>
