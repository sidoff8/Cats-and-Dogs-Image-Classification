  <h3>Image classification!</h3>
  <p>Image classification is the process of taking an input (like a picture) and outputting a class (like “cat”) or a probability that the input is a particular class (“there’s a 90% probability that this input is a cat”). You can look at a picture and know that you’re looking at a terrible shot of your own face, but how can a computer learn to do that?</p>
